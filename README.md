# beatshipper

Since thereâ€™s no way to send GNU zip files through filebeat, this service will be responsible for checking if there are new .gz files based on a path that weâ€™ll explode using globbing, decompress them, send them using the filebeat service with the provided configuration and store them in a local file registry.

It can be used also for not compressed files.
