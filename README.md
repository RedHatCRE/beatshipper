# beatshipper

Since thereâ€™s no way to send GNU zip files through filebeat, this service will be responsible for checking if there are new .gz files based on a path that weâ€™ll explode using globbing, decompress them, send them using the filebeat service with the provided configuration and store them in a local file registry.

It can also be used for non-compressed files.

## Configuration

We should create the configuration in the following file `/etc/beatshipper/beatshipper-conf.yml`. An example is located in the root of the project. We should add the following fields:

- `host`
- `port`
- `path` array of paths that will be exploded using `GLOB`
- `registry`: the name of the file where we'll store the processed files.
- `recheck` time of recheck (re-process) if there are new pending files to send

## Usage:

If we have the right configuration, we can start the program using the following command - It will read the configuration, start checking if there are pending packages that aren't in the registry and send them to the server that is listening using `beats`- e.g. a logstash instance with the `beats` module -:

```
$ beatshipper send
